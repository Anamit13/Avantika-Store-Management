# Avantika-Store-Management
->It is a desktop application developed using electron JS framework for Avantika University store.

->Problem Statement <br>
  Many-a-times it is seen that while buying any product from Avantika Universityâ€™s store, it takes a lot of time for the entry process of the item in the register. And     the product which are bought by the students, once used becomes of no use to them. The expensive products become useless which is not a sustainable way of using         resources. We need to digitalize this system of manual entry in registers and to add a feature such that the products should be reused by other students also.


Objectives
1.	To design an application which can decrease the time of manual entry in registers.
2.	To Promote the use of reused products by new students.
3.	To make some benefit to the students who bought the product and now are of no use.


Functional Requirement
1.	The system shall decrease the time taken for entry
2.	The system shall have minimum fields for entry.
3.	The system shall have less buffering time.
4.	The system shall store the data on submit in the database.
5.	The fields shall not be time taking.	6.	
7.	The system shall send some type of email to promote reusing of products
8.	The system shall sell and buy the reused products
9.	The system shall give the product on loan to other users for a specific time.
10.	The system shall notify store manager if the time limit exceeds.
11.	The system shall generate a unique id for every reusable product.
